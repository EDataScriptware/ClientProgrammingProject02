- Was used to keep up to date 
- Shows accurate progress of my work through time

- The CSS (mostly color and shape) of the entire webpage can be interpreted as two contrast colors for easier readability and understanding message. 
-- Effective use for users who have Dyslexia or Low Vision.

- A LOT and A LOT of time was spent into figuring out how jQuery plugin works. Three jQuery plugin functions correctly: 
    1. Map iFrame (that shows where students worked)
    2. Contact Us iFrame
    3. Header typewriter

- TWO PLUGINS do not function correctly:
    1. Background image changer
    2. Buttons are unable to be triggered and support an external plugin to open and close the tables.

-- In a way, 2 jQuery plugins out of 3 jQuery plugins were met. 

- A not very innovative but the best I can make it to be and could be utilized on a mobile device smoothly. 

- Almost entire Ajax API data were pulled and used effectively. (I do not remember which specific item were not used.)
-- I had asked for Aaron Kelly's perspective on how he calls with ajax.
-- I listed it into my work thinking it was an interesting approach showing myself to you that I am open to changes or new ideas that anyone gives me.
--- I stayed true to my original work and way of doing.

- I used jQuery to set up a title. You had never taught this and I utilized it by calling directly to the document with jQuery and changed the attributes
